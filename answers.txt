2)    Predicted throughput: 18.796 Mbps
      Predicted latency: 121.996 ms
      Actual throughput: 18.471 Mbps
      Actual latency: 120.745 ms
      Explanation of results: The actual throughput and latency was close to my predictions. To predict latency, I added the rtt for each link on the path between h1 and h10. To predict throughput, I chose the minimum throughput for all the links on the path, because this link was the "bottleneck" for sending data.
