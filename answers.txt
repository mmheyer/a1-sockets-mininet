2)    Predicted throughput:   18.796 Mbps
      Predicted latency:      121.996 ms
      Actual throughput:      18.471 Mbps
      Actual latency:         120.745 ms
      Explanation of results: The actual throughput and latency was close to my predictions. 
                              To predict latency, I added the rtt for each link on the path between h1 and h10. 
                              To predict throughput, I chose the minimum throughput for all the links on the path, because this link was the "bottleneck" for sending data.

3.1)  Predicted throughput:   9.398 Mbps
      Predicted latency:      121.996 ms
      Actual throughput:      h1<->h6=9.617 Mbps      h2<->h9=9.251 Mbps
      Actual latency:         h1<->h6=623.683 ms      h2<->h9=656.123 ms
      Explanation of results: While my prediction for the throughput was close, I was off on my prediction for the latency.
                              I made the throughput prediction by taking the throughput of the smallest link (18.796 Mbps) and dividing by the number of hosts (2).
                              I thought the latency would be similar (or slightly larger) despite adding another connection, but it increased significantly. 
                              This could be due to likely due to network congestion and contention for shared resources.

3.2)  Predicted throughput:   6.265 Mbps
      Predicted latency:      1000 ms
      Actual throughput:      h1<->h6=7.227 Mbps    h2<->h9=5.730 Mbps    h5<->h10=6.126 Mbps
      Actual latency:         h1<->h6=587.881 ms    h2<->h9=587.950 ms    h5<->h10=617.349 ms
      Explanation of results: Again, my prediction for throughput was close but latency was off.
                              I estimated throughput similar to in part 3.1, this time dividing the lowest throughput by 3 hosts.
                              I was surprised to see the latency decrease, despite adding an extra connection.
                              This could have happened by chance, but it is also possible that TCP's congestion control algorithms were able to more efficientkly balance three connections.
